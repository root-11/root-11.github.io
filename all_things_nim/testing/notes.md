The basic program `logical.nim` verifies whether a boolean really is true.
The `logical_test.nim` imports and uses this together with unittest which is used as test suite.

Things I learned?

1. nims synta highlighter doesn't run until I press CTRL + S to save. That's okay. I prefer that to having it running constantly.
2. nim will proclaim `indentation error` when a colon is missing from the previous line.
3. the `unittest` suite is just as good as pytest.

More to come.
