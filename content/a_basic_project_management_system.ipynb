    "**Tasks & Dependencies** require resources in the form of materials and skills. Skills determine the time for the task to be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks** ...\n",
    "1. have mutually exclusive options. Do task A and B is not required. Dependending on which path is taken, the projects overall completion time may change.\n",
    "2. are repeated. The dependencies allow these to be listed sequentially.\n",
    "3. have deadlines and fines are due if they're exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects have a critical path that determines the shortest possible time to completion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slack**: Tasks that are not on the critical path have \"slack\" which is the excess time before or after that leads permits earlier or later start(s) without influencing the critical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programmes** programmes are containers of 2 or more projects that must share resources.\n",

    "The inconvenient truth is that durations may depend on \"who\" does the task, or more generally, which resources are assigned to the task.\n",
