How is this page made? Dead simple:

1. There's a python script that discovers any markdown files.

2. Each file is then rendered to static html.

3. The static html pages are served via github.io.


That's it. 

There's no database, no framework, no CMS. 

Just core CSS and HTML.

Go and have a look yourself on [my repo](https://github.com/root-11/root-11.github.io)
