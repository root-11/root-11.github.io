    "# Maximum Delayed Commitment - an corporate strategy that enables Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was recognised that the [waterfall methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) failed the emerging alternative turned up as [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). Agile recognized that most software development is exploratory - a discovery process – where the most productive strategy is to delay the commitment of resources for as long as possible, as this allows information to arrive about what works and what doesn’t’. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formal name for this strategy is **maximum delayed commitment (MDC)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**: Maximum Delayed Commitment (MDC): A strategy that seeks to optimize resource allocation and decision-making in a way that maximizes the chances of project success while minimizing waste and unnecessary effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst Agile has been treated by old school managers as the antithesis to planning, MDC is well known to most financial managers: Commit as many resources as you must, to achieve a goal but no more. When making experiments concerned with which of N approaches that is more feasible or productive, make rapid, short concurrent experiments that will provide more information and lead to elimination of high-risk choices. Take actions like in a game of chess: You don’t know what the opponent will do, so you commit to moves that are likely to lead to a fruitful outcome without exposing yourself to unnecessary risk. Offensive and defensive game play at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For software development, MDC leads to high throughput as tasks only are committed to once they are crystal clear (offensive game play), and it keeps flexibility of the development as more information is obtained about what works and what doesn’t (defensive game play).\n",

    "## The matrix organisation is dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common practice in large organisations is currently to create matrix organisations, where everyone is supppsoed to be speciazlised. As matrix organisations generally favor a technological branch (database, cloud, ...) and an organisational branch (ecom, b2b), two problems appear: \n",
    "\n",
    "First, people who are hired into a role associated with a technology (DB, backend, cloud, ...) have an incentive to increase the usage of their technology to establish a bastion of dependencies across the organisation disregarding whether this actually leads to the best solution for the end-users. One could argue that [Workday.com](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Workday-have-such-poor-user-experience) is an classic example hereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, as the matrix-organisation delimits the range where a developer can contribute - for example in ecom, not b2b - the organisation has prematurely committed to exploiting the developers knowledge in a single division. As an employees incentives often are directly linked to the division they belong to, there is now no point for the developer to contribute to libraries that may be of benefit in other divisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **opposite** of MDC: The organisation diagram has **prematurely committed the resources** to a very narrow-minded scope. \n",
    "\n",
    "MDC instead introduces a competence pool where developers can “jump onto” any development task at any time. It is more akin to the organisation in the army, where general purpose training enable soldiers to deploy standardised tactics at scale, where the individual soldiers task may be quite simple, but where the sum of all the standards (SOPs, tactics, strategy) create a daunting force.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that to work, the things that software developers build, must be decoupled and small (packages, small services), so that it is easy to get one’s head around what development is required. A key step in \"getting one's head around what is required\" is Test Driven Development(TDD), as the suite of tests informs even the most novice developer that nothing that should be working, has been broken after he or she introduces new code. Now, it would be insufficient to speak of TDD without including the test environment: It is obvious to even the most novice developer that the software eventually needs to run \"somewhere\" and with that comes the question of what that production environment may look like. This makes deployment to production another predictable step, which according to MDC can be prepared far in advance of any project or feature specific source code being written. Why? Because you can't run any tests without declaring the environment. So the strategy of maximum delayed commitment claims zero delay. All the information is available. We can refer to this as standardizing the toolchain to optimize for flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the “old way of working” developers would build something and then hand it over to Ops to run it. Ops would typically find little documentation and would have to “rediscover” or reverse engineer how to run it. Never mind the scalability problems that eventually would come, when the developer’s favourite choice of DB no longer was fit for purpose. Developers would always be sucked back into operations to help to figure out how to overcome some new problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MDC the “old way of working” is turned on its head and only allow developers to use standard project templates that already are supported by Ops with CI/CD pipelines for their projects: The developers fill in the blanks (new modules, tests, etc.) and are commonly able to release new services or features every 3-4 days. They thrive by not having to worry about infrastructure, scalability, or other external risk factors. They don’t worry about what DB is used. They just use what’s in the “new project template” and love it. Ops also used to be a onestop shop for firefighting and stress, but with a corporation implementing MDC it becomes satisfying to work in Ops as solving a problem with a database or some infrastructure scale across the whole infrastructure as code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledging that Ops must deploy the pipelines before Dev starts writing tests, means that Ops will rarely be involved in the deployment of software. "

    "## Management\n",
    "\n",
    "With MDC a software engineering manager only needs to ask what people are working on right now, to have complete overview and will need no more than two whiteboards:\n",
    "1.  With tasks in progress.\n",
    "2.  With product roadmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we’ve already declared to the executive suite that the development process is explorative, so my job is to translate the strategic vision into a series of small experiments, that de-risk and structure the effort into delivery. I cannot promise when something will be done. All I can do is publish what we know and then we have jointly to judge whether we have enough resources to deliver the vision for the product. This removes the silly idea of believing in chains of estimates where the quality of guesses based on incomplete information eventually will lead to embarrasment for someone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality is that there is no need to delude one another with estimates as the reality is that there are things that we simply don’t know. The product vision may require adjustments after user feedback is collected. The scope may be reduced radically as the users don’t understand certain features. All this changes the conversation in the executive suite from “when will vision X be ready” to “what evidence do we have that we are still on the right track”? This is great because “asking for evidence” leads to collaborative dissemination and reminds everyone about the linkage from “what is being worked on right now” and how that adds value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that more than 50% of software projects – by quantity – never mature fully. To make these losses acceptable, they must be small. And when they’re small they’re easier to monitor. This means that management overhead drops because if someone wants to know “the progress on X”, they speak with the lead developer who owns the feature request. And there no longer is a requirement for a project management office (PMO) either.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to an executive mindset that projects should be considered high-risk and that ultra narrow focus should on what is value adding should set the agenda:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New UI? Test early if it works for the users.\n",
    "- Faster UX? Measure the bottlenecks. Improve only things that have impact.\n",
    "- Too high running costs? Measure spend to scale the infrastructure.\n",
    "- Too slow release? Measure where the updates are and decouple modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Dave Farley puts it: \"I'm a software engineer - I use science to make useful things\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## So to all the MBAs out there – what does MDC mean to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "First the organisation has to change from *functions* to *missions* that are focused on deliverables (AT/UAT) that benefit the business: The old school approach where Dev, Ops, Database, and cloud teams lives in some matrix organisation goes in the bin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important step is to insert a Pitbull ex-marine drill sergeant as DevOps director, who is the only person who sets development priorities. Just as the word “commitment” reveals in “maximum delayed commitment” it also means that work that has been “committed” to is irreversible. Disruptions and scope creep are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is your new organisation diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![no more matrix organisations](artwork/agile_organisation1.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "You may freak out for a moment and wonder where to find a person with a certain set of skills, but then realise that all the developers probably knows each other and all you have to do is ask the most senior member. You may also wonder, how do I know who is working on which project? Are all my resources utilised? Again that is a silly question, because when we treat people as adults, you will be astonished how smart and creative they are if you just communicate \"what matters most\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- User engagement dropping? Ask for evidence. Someone will make a survey. Someone else will do a user study.\n",
    "- Too high running costs? Ask for how to reduce the costs. Someone will measure it and come up with a solution.\n",
    "- Not being able to keep up with the competition? Someone will look at how to decouple and improve release speed. Someone else will make a temporary solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in cultures with great power distance between manager and subordinate, the power of an executive asking a question should not be underestimated as it leads to greater mutual respect and - often - rapid progress of the simple reason that no executive can know all the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next is to assure that strategic apex does their job, which is to define a portfolio which produces the “maximum utility for the greatest number of users” using a de-risked tech stack where automation of CI/CD pipelines and undisrupted developer focus leads to **high throughput**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We devide the strategic apex into two:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group 1: Offensive**: First, we call the group who claims to “own” the customers (typically sales or marketing) and attempt to synthesize what the markets want. We want them to agree internally on what matters to the markets that the software serves. Even if they can't agree on what the customers want, they must agree on the experiments that will reveal the right course of action; and they must agree to commit to the outcome of those experiments. Last, once this has been agreed, user-groups are defined for user acceptance tests and from an investment perspective this group will finance these \"product\" tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group 2: Defensive**: The second group are the ones who claim what technology is suitable (typically a mix of procurement and architects) and are made to agree on what technologies they want to own. This leads to reduced complexity of the tech stack, which in turn makes it easier to onboard new developers and replace developers who eventually leave. The job of this group is to assure that whatever the first group comes up with, can technically be managed at no more than the baseline overhead. This group is financially responsible for that baseline. A smart group 2 uses as much open source software as sensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group 1+2**: The combination of these two executive groups will create a tension (offensive + defensive) between their interests that will lead to short, end-user-oriented development projects which quickly reveal their value as acceptance criteria (or are thrown out). Group 1 won’t have any incentive to come up with multi-year megalomanic projects (risky, value unknown) and Group 2 who owns the expenses won’t try to squeeze everything into snowflake or SAP, just because there is a procurement contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final gatekeeper is our Marine Pitbull ops-director who ia responsible for assuring that all projects are limited in scope. The Ops-dir will hence not release work to the developer pool, unless the acceptance criteria can be translated into [User Acceptance Tests (AT/UAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The compound effect is that it becomes transparent how the decisions made in strategic apex either produces a portfolio of value adding (meaningful) and de-risked projects or wastes the company’s' resources. The link is direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum Delayed Commitment (MDC) is a strategy for implementing Agile in corporations, which:\n",
    "- promotes CI/CD with high throughput through TDD, decoupling and standardised pipelines.\n",
    "- dissolves the matrix organisation in favour of pooled resources, as this removes organisational barriers for collaboration.\n",
    "- forces alignment at the executive level.\n",
    "- makes the decision of executives directly linked to the bottom line.\n",
    "- promotes learning on the job\n",
    "- aggresively filters successful and fallacious initiatives for the common good of the organisation.\n",
