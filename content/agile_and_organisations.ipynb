    "# Maximum Delayed Commitment - an strategy for Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was recognised that the [waterfall methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) failed the emerging alternative turned up as [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). Agile recognized that most software development is exploratory - a discovery process – where the most productive strategy is to delay the commitment of resources for as long as possible, as this allows information to arrive about what works and what doesn’t’. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formal name for this strategy is **maximum delayed commitment (MDC)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**: Maximum Delayed Commitment (MDC): A strategy that seeks to optimize resource allocation and decision-making in a way that maximizes the chances of project success while minimizing waste and unnecessary effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst Agile has been treated by old school management as the antithesis to planning, MDC is well known to most financial managers: Commit as many resources as you must, to achieve a goal but no more. When making experiments concerned with which of N approaches that is more feasible or productive, make rapid, short concurrent experiments that will provide more information and lead to elimination of high-risk choices. Take actions like in a game of chess: You don’t know what the opponent will do, so you commit to moves that are likely to lead to a fruitful outcome without exposing yourself to unnecessary risk. Offensive and defensive game play at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For software development, MDC leads to high throughput as tasks only are committed to once they are crystal clear, and it keeps flexibility of the development as more information is obtained about what works and what doesn’t. \n",
    "\n",
    "MDC clashes with the outdated view of organisation diagrams where everyone is specialized and introduces a competence pool who can “jump onto” any development task at any time.\n",
    "For that to work the things that software developers build, must be decoupled and small (packages, small services), so that it is easy to get one’s head around what development is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "MDC also favors the test-driven approach (TDD), as the suite of tests guarantees that nothing that should be working, has been broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment to production is also predictable and can be prepared far in advance of any project or feature specific source code being written. We can refer to this as standardizing the toolchain to optimize for flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the “old way of working” developers would build something and then hand it over to Ops to run it. Ops would typically find little documentation and would have to “rediscover” or reverse engineer how to run it. Never mind the scalability problems that eventually would come, when the developer’s favourite choice of DB no longer was fit for purpose. Developers would always be sucked back into operations to help to figure out how to overcome some new problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MDC the “old way of working” is turned on its head and only allow developers to use standard project templates that already are supported by Ops with CI/CD pipelines for their projects: The developers fill in the blanks (new modules, tests, etc.) and are commonly able to release new services or features every 3-4 days. They thrive by not having to worry about infrastructure, scalability, or other external risk factors. They don’t worry about what DB is used. They just use what’s in the “new project template” and love it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies for Ops, who rarely is involved in the deployment of software as this is automated. It is also fun to work in Ops, as it becomes possible to solve a problem with a database or some infrastructure once and for all – as infrastructure as code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A software engineering manager only needs to ask what people are working on right now, to have complete overview and will need no more than two whiteboards:\n",
    "1.  With tasks in progress.\n",
    "2.  With product roadmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we’ve already declared to the executive suite that the development process is explorative, so my job is to translate the strategic vision into a series of small experiments, that de-risk and structure the effort into delivery. I cannot promise when something will be done. All I can do is publish what we know and then we have jointly to judge whether we have enough resources to deliver the vision for the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to delude one another with estimates as the reality is that there are things that we simply don’t know. The product vision may require adjustments after user feedback is collected. The scope may be reduced radically as the users don’t understand certain features. All this changes the conversation in the executive suite from “when will vision X be ready” to “what evidence do we have that we are still on the right track”? This is great because “asking for evidence” leads to collaborative dissemination and reminds everyone about the linkage from “what is being worked on right now” and how that adds value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that more than 50% of software projects – by quantity – never mature fully. To make these losses acceptable, they must be small. And when they’re small they’re easier to monitor.\n",
    "This means that management overhead drops because if someone wants to know “the progress on X”, they speak with the lead developer who owns the feature request. And there no longer is a requirement for a project management office (PMO).\n",
    "\n",
    "## So to all the MBAs out there – what does MDC mean to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "The old school approach where Dev, Ops, Database, and cloud teams were separate goes in the bin. The most important step is to insert a Pitbull ex-marine drill sergeant as DevOps director, who is the only person who sets development priorities. Just as the word “commitment” reveals in “maximum delayed commitment” it also means that work that has been “committed” to is irreversible. Disruptions and scope creep are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, your view of the organisation diagram changes radically:\n",
    "\n",
    "![no more matrix organisations](artwork/agile_organisation1.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "The next is to assure that strategic apex does their job.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group 1**: First, we call the group who claims to “own” the customers (sales typically) and attempt to synthesize what the markets want. We want them to agree internally on what matters to the markets that the software serves. Once this has been agreed, user-groups are defined for user acceptance tests and from an investment perspective this group will finance these product tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group 2**: The second group are the ones who claim what technology is suitable (typically procurement and power point architects) and are made to agree on what technologies they want to own. This leads to reduced complexity of the tech stack, which in turn makes it easier to onboard new developers and replace developers who eventually leave. The job of the second group is to assure that whatever the first group comes up with, can technically be managed at no more than the baseline overhead. This group is financially responsible for that baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**= 1+2**: In combination the tension between these two executive groups will lead to short, end-user-oriented development projects which quickly reveal their value (or are thrown out). Group 1 won’t come up with megalomanic projects and Group 2 won’t try to squeeze everything into snowflake or SAP, just because there is a procurement contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "This produces [Acceptance Tests (AT/UAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing) and if they're not present, the Marine Pitbull ops-director will not allow work to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the benefit of agile becomes self-evident: short projects that group 1 consider as providing the “maximum utility for the greatest number of users” is matched with a known tech stack where automation of CI/CD pipelines and undisrupted developer focus leads to high throughput through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organisation has now changed from *functions* to *missions* that are focused on deliverables (AT/UAT) that benefit the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "It came only at the cost of throwing out the matrix-organisation whilst each of the two groups relinquish their functional siloes. The synergy that occur as barriers for collaboration vanish amongst the developer means that the impact of the executive suite is now directly linked to the bottomline: \n",
    "\n",
    "Either the strategic apex produces a portfolio of value adding (meaningful) and de-risked projects or they are wasting the company’s' resources. It's really that simple.\n",
    "\n",
