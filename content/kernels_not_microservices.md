# Forget Microservices. Build Simulations.
*Why deterministic event kernels outperform enterprise stacks — in clarity, speed, and testability.*

## Section 1: What If Software Evolved Like a Simulation?

For over 20 years, I've watched the same pattern unfold across organizations: as systems age, their architects harden. The software that once served a clear purpose becomes sacred ground — not because it still works well, but because it's all the team knows how to protect. Innovation slows. Extension becomes surgery.

At the heart of this stasis is a structural flaw: teams are built to defend their technologies, not to deliver results. You get database people, business logic people, UI people — and architecture follows that division. It’s not a team aligned toward product excellence. It’s a labor union with a build pipeline.

But simulation engines force a different reality. You either compute at real-time (or faster), or you don't. Simulation requires strict event ordering and microsecond precision. Try to distribute that across Docker containers and network latency — it collapses.

So I ditched the stack — database, business logic, interface layer — and replaced it with a high-performance event kernel: a loop that processes and emits strictly ordered events, with plugins that listen, react, and log.

The result? A **1000x improvement in throughput**:
- 10x gain by avoiding multi-node I/O.
- 10x gain by eliminating query-bound logic.
- 10x gain by simplifying structure.

Testing became trivial. Features became composable. I’ve rebuilt the engine five times, each generation better than the last. Why keep code that no longer fits its environment?

Software should evolve. If it can’t, it deserves extinction.

## Section 2: The Event Kernel — Minimalism With a Clock

At the heart of this model is a simple loop: a clocked event queue.

The kernel does one thing: pop the next scheduled event by timestamp. Execute its handler. That handler updates the state of an agent — a truck, a robot, a job — and optionally schedules more events in the future.

This isn’t a multi-threaded async system. It’s single-threaded, deterministic, and strictly ordered. You can simulate packet delay, signal lag, or planning time just by offsetting timestamps.

### State Lives Where It's Used

There’s no global state store or database. Each agent owns its own state in a data structure optimized for throughput. Preprocessing is king: all-pairs routing, cacheable plans, event prediction — anything to reduce CPU time during simulation.

### Plugins Are Listeners — And Listeners Only

A plugin is a listener that reacts to specific events. If no one subscribes, the event doesn’t need to be emitted. Plugins must respect the contract: minimal input, strict timing, no blocking. Serialization is unnecessary — these are in-memory messages, not remote RPCs.

### Bounded Asynchrony — Without Breaking the Clock

Some plugins, like route replanning, require compute time. That’s allowed — as long as they promise to respond by a specific future time. The kernel will continue simulation until that point. If it arrives and the result isn’t ready, it raises a warning.

This allows controlled parallelism without compromising determinism.

### Testing is Built-In

Every plugin is testable in total isolation. The kernel itself is just a mailman with a clock. There’s no mocking or orchestration — just event in, event out.

### The Only Limitation is Physics

Once the kernel is tight, limits are physical. A Rust implementation may process 40x the events of Python. If plugins slow things down, profile and optimize — but the kernel won’t hide performance issues from you.

## Section 3: Designing Systems from Events

Let’s take two examples.

### A Word Processor

- Keystrokes are events.
- The document is an agent with mutable state.
- Plugins handle spell check, autosave, and prediction by listening to the event stream.
- Undo/redo? Just replay the event log backwards or forwards.

No services. No glue code. Everything reacts to the stream. The UI is optional.

### A Logistics System

- Trucks, workers, and orders are agents.
- Routing, replanning, and tracking are plugins.
- The kernel simulates everything in order — 10x or 100x faster than real-time.
- Output: a complete, timestamped record of the system state and actions.

You don’t need distributed databases to model distributed reality. You need events and time.

### Sidebar: SAP HANA — In Memory, Still Out of Shape

SAP HANA promises performance by moving everything to RAM. But the architecture stays transactional and query-driven. You still write business logic in ABAP or JavaScript. You still patch side effects with services.

HANA is an in-memory database with okayish plugins.  
The Event Kernel is a clock with disciplined listeners.  
RAM isn’t a cache — it’s the world.

## Section 4: Why This Pattern Hasn’t Taken Over

1. **It cuts across silos** — No room for role-based turf.
2. **It’s scientific, not political** — No dashboards to hide behind.
3. **It looks too simple** — No Kubernetes footprint to show off.
4. **The toolchain isn’t built for it** — No off-the-shelf framework to start from.
5. **It requires knowing what you're building** — You can’t fake simulation clarity.

---

## Section 5: How to Transition

1. **Start with simulation** — Model a process with known inputs and outputs.
2. **Rewrite bloated components as plugins** — If you can’t express it in events, it’s too complex.
3. **Starve the database** — Use it for logging, not logic.
4. **UI as listener** — Treat the UI as a consumer, not a source of truth.
5. **The kernel is the oracle** — Want to know what the system does? Feed it events and watch.

## Final Word

You don’t need a service mesh to build reliable systems. You need a clock, some memory, and a set of disciplined listeners.

Let software evolve.  
Let unfit abstractions die.  
And above all: **treat time as sacred.**
