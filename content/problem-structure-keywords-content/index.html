<div style="margin-bottom: 3ch;text-transform: none;">2020-05-31</div><div class="heading">problem structure keywords content</div><hr/>    
<p>For over 20 years I've been helping engineers to solve problems in the realm 
of mathematics and for the past 12 years I've been using and refining the same 
structured approach for scientists, engineers and students when completing 
their assignments. I call refer to the approach as 
problem-structure-keywords-content.</p>
<p>The approach started as a vague idea whilst I was participating in team exercises
whilst doing my Master's degree in supply chain management at
Cranfield School of Management in the UK. There were many very clever people on 
the course and the background they had was very diverse. Yet they all seemed
to "beat around the bush" as the english would say, rather than focus on the 
problem when attempting to solve group work. It appeared to me, like they were 
attempting to map keywords in the 
assignments to rephrase or paraphrase the problem, rather than taking it as 
face value - as we mathematicians tend to do.</p>
<p>So I wondered why?</p>
<h3>What is the Problem?</h3>
<p>I find that a lot of people read through assignments, documents and emails without
clarity of what the problem is. They try to hold as many little details in memory
and develop a comprehensive mental map of what is going on in a report or 
assignment context. And then they loose the aim through mental exhaustion. 
I'm an astute observer, but no neuro-scienists, so I can't say
why this happens. Only that it is observable with almost every assignment.</p>
<p>So I recommend to read through the available material with a single goal in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determine what the core problem is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevermind the rest. Just focus on defining the problem so it may be addressed
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">first-principles</a>.</p>
<p>This tends to focus peoples minds on the issue at hand and the evidence that
points towards it.  </p>
<p>In the context of assignments, the clarity becomes evident when students start 
by citing the sentences that define the core problem and ignore everything else.</p>
<p>In the context of team meetings for engineers who contribute with various fields
of expertise, the clarity appears when a systems model of the problem has been drawn and
reduced to it's absolute core and they speak of how variables influence one-another 
instead of asking what-if questions.<br />
In particular engineers tend to highlight their importance by stating that 
everything is important when working in the particular field of expertise, and
whilst that may be true it is not necessary of equal importance to the core 
problem at hand.</p>
<h3>Structure the work!</h3>
<p>The worst meetings end with everyone going off doing the thing they think is 
most important, without a systematic coordination of efforts. My worst experience
in this regard came from an EU-funded project, where a consortium of companies with 
poorly aligned interests (aside from justifying the EU spend) sought to solve 
an otherwise well defined problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When work is structured, assuring that one activity leads towards the goal is
more likely. Structured work prevents rework - even when the methods may require
research, because structure does not permit work to be started before its preceding tasks are completed. </p>
<p>The key benefit of structuring the work is that the order and hence
priorities of the work become clear, so that contributors can focus on the 
delivery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For written assignments, this typically means putting a skeleton of the document
in place: start with the problem definition at the top, then put the headlines 
in order for the subsections so they match the evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>For engineering and applied sciences, draw out the dependency diagram and check
it forwards to assess whether completion of the requirements really suffice to 
solve the subsequent task. If anything is not completely sufficient, add 
verification tasks.</p>
<h3>Keywords - what to keep and what to ignore.</h3>
<p>Let's argue that you have defined the problem and devised some structure for the
work that you're about to do, but there are lots of "keywords" in the back of 
your mind: Is this important? Is that important? You've just read the assignment,
the specification or the report and now you need to make up your mind about what
to include and what to ignore. </p>
<p>The best answer I've found is don't let it bother you. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the keywords into the media that illustrates the structure of your work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add the keywords to your dependency diagram, your assignment structure in the 
sections where they become relevant. </p>
<p>For example I find that engineers who just got involved in 
a project for trouble shooting show recency bias from their previous project
and now want to assure that the same problem doesn't occur again. These engineers
will feel far more comfortable if the "keywords" associated with their experience
of their last solved problem are visible on the dependency diagram where it will
make a difference - i.e. in a particular location in the structure of work.</p>
<p>Students who do applied science assignments take notice that a choice of methodology
needs to happen, but they're not sure which one is better. And that's great because they
can add the keywords to the document outline as a subsection "choice of methodology"
where they eliminate the methods one by one. This shows mastery of the topic and
I know of no teacher who would frown upon that.</p>
<h3>Content - who delivers what?</h3>
<p>Now that its clear as conscience <em>what the problem is</em> (1), how the <em>structure</em>
of your work intends to address the problem (2) and which <em>keywords</em> are of 
significance (3), it will require self-sabotage to your own plan, to fail.</p>
<p>That said, in group efforts clarity does not guarantee who does what! 
So by assigning tasks to the members who best can deliver the content is imperative.</p>
<p>In student assignments, this often means that you - the one and only - will do 
all the work. Independently. However <strong><em>do</em></strong> use the opportunity to check your 
problem definition and your document outline with your teacher. Typically they will
consider this a good sign, and if all students ask the same odd questions, the 
teacher might recognise that they've missed something in their assignment definition. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In engineering there's a delicate balance between the most skilled and the most 
interested person or team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In software engineering I find that there is less stress if the 
more senior engineers stay as close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method">critical path</a>
as possible. Junior engineers use the slack time on non-critical path
tasks to learn what the critical path modules do in code reviews. 
In this process the junior engineers WILL ask unexpected peripheral questions 
that will lead to a more robust code, or including if something could be done 
"smarter". Through this conversation, the junior devs will evolve a better 
understanding of why thing are as they are, and the 
senior devs will discover potential improvements or shortcuts that the junior 
devs can experiment with in the slack time.</p>
<p>A quick disclaimer: Senior doesn't mean the oldest. It is the person with most
experience in the topic that is being addressed. I'm very good at devising 
datastructures that are algorithmically efficient, but I'm a total newbie, when
it comes to packaging and deloying software. So I might be a grey-beard, but 
there are others who are more senior/experienced with the topic.</p>
