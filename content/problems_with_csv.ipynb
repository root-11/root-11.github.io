    "This applies to all TSV, CSV, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [csv_reader](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) has many features, but getting the settings right is quite a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "I look after a corporate data analysis platform and found that the largest waste of time over a due course of 76,000 engineering hours came from figuring out how to import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To back this with some numbers I find from 1.5Tb of zipped csv data (billions of rows of data):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reattempts for engineers to upload the same file with different encoding: 4.1x (Poisson distributed).\n",
    "- CSV imports that are accepted by the engineer: 95/105\n",
    "- Correct inference of datetime: 2 / 396 cols with name date, time or datetime (in 17 languages)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Reading CSV files has been treated as an encoding problem. It evidently isn't. It's a pattern recognition problem.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing csv-readers and file sniffers fail because they:\n",
    "- don't detect encoding correctly or work on bad encoding.\n",
    "- typically only read the first line after the headers.\n",
    "- don't handle text escapes during column detection.\n",
    "- `dateutils` parser only evaluates a single value and will always say that 1.2.2012 is mm.dd.yyyy despite that the next value might be 29.2.2012 (I've got plenty of tests with that problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an ugly example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Birthdate, (Family\\nnames), Father, Mother, Child, known for\\n1879-4-14, Einstein, Hermann, Pauline, Albert,\"\\nGeneral relativity,\\nSpecial relativity,\\nPhotoelectric effect\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "That should be (including some text escape):\n",
    "\n",
    "|Birthdate| (Family<br>names)| Father | Mother | Child | known for |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|1879-4-14| Einstein| Hermann| Pauline| Albert| General relativity,<br>Special relativity,<br>Photoelectric effect|\n",

    "To add a non-breaking package to pandas, would enables pandas csv_reader can receive the keyword \"analyse\" and ignore the default keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "When  `pandas.csv_reader(somepath, analyse=True)` is called, the keyword will trigger the usage of a function in the top of the file_reader that will:\n",
    "\n",
