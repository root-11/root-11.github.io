    "RE:\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue arises from how Python handles module imports relative to the script that you execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you run your script as `__main__` from the `benchmarks` folder, Python uses the folder containing the script as the base for resolving module imports, which affects relative imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `benchmarks.py` directly, the Python interpreter doesn't know how to handle the `routing` module import because it's not in the `PYTHONPATH` or the standard modules folder. The folder structure does not tell Python where to find the `routing` module automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify the `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable**   \n",
    "   - On the command line:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/project:$PYTHONPATH\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - On Windows:\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",
    "     set PYTHONPATH=C:\\path\\to\\your\\project;%PYTHONPATH%\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This makes Python aware of where to find your `routing` module when running `benchmarks.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use `sys.path`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can add the project's root directory to `sys.path` within `benchmarks.py`:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import sys\n",
    "   from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Add the root directory to sys.path\n",
    "   sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent))\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Now you can import routing\n",
    "   from routing import dijkstra\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This approach adds the root directory to `sys.path`, allowing you to import `routing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run from the Project Root**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instead of running `benchmarks.py` from within the `benchmarks` folder, run it from the projectâ€™s root directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python benchmarks/benchmarks.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This way, Python treats the project root as the base directory and finds the `routing` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these modifications `benchmarks.py` can now run."
