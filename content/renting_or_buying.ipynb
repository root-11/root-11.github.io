    "# To buy or rent & invest? A view on the housing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I discovered some old notes in my archives and after a recent conversation with a friend about \"why am I renting?\" I decided to share my calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Scotland, the property purchase process is similar to the rest of the UK, although there are some differences in the costs, particularly regarding the tax on property purchases, which is known as Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) instead of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT). Also, for first-time buyers, there are reliefs and thresholds that may reduce the overall tax payable. Specifically for first-time buyers in Scotland, there is a LBTT relief that increases the zero-tax threshold, which can significantly reduce the overall tax payable for properties under a certain value. However, for more expensive properties, the LBTT can still be a considerable expense. The rates are progressive, so the percentage only applies to the portion of the property price within each tax band. Let's first understand the process of purchasing a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Budgeting and Mortgage Pre-Approval:\n",
    "    - Determine your budget, taking into account your savings and how much mortgage you can afford.\n",
    "    - It's wise to get a mortgage in principle (also known as an agreement in principle), which gives you an idea of how much a lender might offer you and shows sellers you're a serious buyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finding a Property:\n",
    "    - Start your property search online on real estate websites, with estate agents, or by looking for property ads in newspapers and local bulletins.\n",
    "    - Consider the location, type of property, size, and other essential criteria that meet your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Viewings and Making an Offer:\n",
    "    - Arrange viewings for properties you're interested in. It's often advisable to visit a property more than once at different times of the day.\n",
    "    - Once you find a suitable property, make an offer through the estate agent. The offer is usually subject to contract and any surveys you wish to have conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hiring Solicitors and Conducting Surveys:\n",
    "    - Upon acceptance of your offer, hire a solicitor or conveyancer to handle the legal aspects of the purchase.\n",
    "    - Your mortgage lender will require a valuation survey to confirm the property's worth. You may also opt for more detailed surveys, such as a Homebuyers Report or a full structural survey, to check for any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Mortgage Formal Application:\n",
    "    - Proceed with a formal mortgage application through your chosen lender, providing all the necessary documentation and details about the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Exchange of Contracts:\n",
    "    - Once the solicitors have completed all necessary checks, you'll be ready to exchange contracts with the seller. This is when you pay a deposit (usually 10% of the purchase price), and the agreement to buy and sell becomes legally binding.\n",
    "    - You'll also agree on a completion date, which is when the property officially becomes yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Completion:\n",
    "    - On the completion date, your solicitor will transfer the remaining funds to the seller's solicitor, and you'll receive the keys to the property.\n",
    "    - You're now the legal owner of the property and can move in.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Post-Completion:\n",
    "    - Your solicitor will handle the payment of Stamp Duty Land Tax (if applicable) and register you as the new owner with the Land Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Moving In:\n",
    "    - Finally, you can move into your new home. You might need to arrange for utilities, broadband, and other services to be set up or transferred to your name.\n",

    "The capital efficiency for the house purchase scenario is approximately 0.71, indicating that for every index unit invested, the return is less than the initial investment, reflecting a decrease in value when adjusted for inflation and costs over 25 years. In contrast, the capital efficiency for renting and investing in the S&P 500 scenario is approximately 1.62, showing that for every index unit invested, the return more than doubles the initial investment, even after adjusting for inflation. \n",
    "This analysis suggests that, from a purely financial perspective and based on the assumptions made, investing in the S&P 500 over 25 years offers a significantly higher capital efficiency compared to purchasing a house."
