<p>Understanding the principles of genes and mutation as the driving mechanism
for evolution is common today. Less common is the availability of a minimal
viable <a href="example.py">example</a>, that showcases the method.<br />
So here's an example I've used to enlighten friends, where I deliberately
deviate from pep-8 to only introduce imports when they're needed.</p>
<p>To solve the Traveling Salesmans Problem (TSP), we need cities to travel to, 
and to keep the world simple, we have only <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to worry about, and
use a straight line distance:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple

City = namedtuple("City", ["x", "y", "id"])

def distance(a, b):
    return ((a.x - b.x) ** 2 + (a.y - b.y) ** 2) ** (1 / 2)
</code></pre>
<p>With this out of the way, the next element is a map: </p>
<ol>
<li>We want to keep the cities in a dictionary, for easy of lookup.</li>
<li>We want the cities to be on the map, so we set a max <code>x</code> and a max <code>y</code> value.</li>
<li>
<p>We want to be able to generate the cities somewhat random.</p>
<p>import random
random.seed(43)  # set the seed for repeatability.</p>
<p>def make_map(n_cities, x_max=1200, y_max=600):
    cities = {}
    for city in range(n_cities):
        x, y = random.randint(0, x_max), random.randint(0, y_max)
        c = City(x, y, id=f"{x},{y}")
        cities[c.id] = c
    return cities</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can now make with any number of cities in a single line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; city_map = make_map(n_cities=5)
</code></pre>
<p>Making a random route visiting all cities, should also be easy, as we can choose
any random sequence that contains all towns:</p>
<pre><code>def make_random_route(city_map):
    """ creates a random route. """
    cities = list(city_map)
    random.shuffle(cities)
    return cities
</code></pre>
<p>To determine which of two routes is the shorter, it is nice to have a function 
that does the work for us. Just remember one thing:<br />
The TSP returns to start after traveling through all cities, so the distance
must include the consideration that it returns to start after all cities have
been visited.</p>
<pre><code>def route_length(citymap, route):
    dist = 0.0
    a = route[0]
    for b in route[1:] + route[:1]:
        city_a, city_b = citymap[a], citymap[b]
        dist += distance(city_a, city_b)
        a = b
    return int(dist)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's make a helper to look at it:</p>
<pre><code>from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from itertools import count
map_no = count()

def plot(citymap, route):
    plt.figure()
    xs = [c.x for c in citymap.values()]
    ys = [c.y for c in citymap.values()]

    plt.plot(xs, ys, 'o')

    a = route[0]
    for b in route[1:] + route[:1]:
        city_a, city_b = citymap[a], citymap[b]
        plt.plot([city_a.x, city_b.x], [city_a.y, city_b.y], 'bo-', clip_on=False)
        a = b

    plt.title("({}) length: {:,}".format(next(map_no), route_length(citymap, route)))
    plt.show()
</code></pre>
<p>Then plot it:</p>
<pre><code>first_route = make_random_route(city_map)
plot(city_map, first_route)
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="1" src="myplot.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>From this point we can <strong><em>mutate</em></strong> our <code>first_route</code> simply by changing the order
in which we visit the different cities. It would work this way:</p>
<p>If we have 9 cities as a list like this:</p>
<pre><code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
</code></pre>
<p>We can select a random index point in the list and swap the numbers in the position 
before and after the index point </p>
<pre><code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
         ^--- here.
</code></pre>
<p>The position with the one after:</p>
<p>before [1,2,3,4,<em><strong>5,6</strong></em>,7,8,9]
after  [1,2,3,4,<em><strong>6,5</strong></em>,7,8,9]</p>
<p>We can express this change as a very simple function:</p>
<pre><code>def mutate(route):
    new_route = route[:]   # copy the route
    cut = random.randint(1, len(route)-2)  # select the index point.
    new_route[cut], new_route[cut+1] = route[cut+1], route[cut]  # swap the values.
    return new_route
</code></pre>
<p>The one thing that remains to be discussed is the relationship between fitness
and evolution. We want the "fittest" to be the shortest path.  </p>
<p>Lets' try it out and check if the new route is better. Spoiler alert: I won't be.</p>
<pre><code>new_route = mutate(first_route)
plot(city_map, new_route)
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="2" src="myplot2.png" /></p>
<pre><code>before = route_length(city_map, first_route)
after = route_length(city_map, new_route)
print("distance before:", before, ", distance after:", after)
&gt;&gt;&gt; distance before: 2701, distance after: 3480
</code></pre>
<p>As you observe, the mutation is not better than the first randomly created 
route. This leads us to acknowledge that randomised evolution is quite wasteful, 
despite that it can find a good solution. To overcome this we require retention
of the <em>fittest</em> solution:</p>
<pre><code>generations = 30                               # number of generations to explore
shortest_distance = float('inf')

for _ in range(generations):
    new_route = mutate(first_route)            # make mutation
    dist = route_length(city_map, new_route)   # measure fitness.
    if dist &lt; shortest_distance:               # retain fittest solution.
        first_route = new_route
        shortest_distance = dist

print("shortest distance after", generations, ":", shortest_distance)
plot(city_map, first_route)
</code></pre>
<p>The for loop will now generate solutions, test their fitness and retain the better.<br />
Each iteration will look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="ga_tsp" src="ga_tsp.gif" /> </p>
<p>And the winner is:</p>
<p><img alt="3" src="myplot3.png" /></p>
