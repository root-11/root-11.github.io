    "# Supply Chain Modelling problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It bothers me that SCM still lives in the era of spreadsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several textbooks which give a reasonable introduction to the topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inventory Control - Models and Methods by Dieter Bartmann and Martin J. Beckmann (1992)\n",
    "- Inventory Control and Management by Donald Waters (2003)\n",
    "- Modeling the supply chain by Jeremy Shapiro (2007)\n",
    "\n",
    "But when running through literature nobody connects the dots that turns the vague idealised ideas presented in these textbooks into something that is applicable to practice.\n",
    "This is probably a brutal statement to the authors, but I assure you, I mean them no disrespect. The written material is merely a product of the era of spreadsheets.\n",
    "Spreadsheets have a major disadvantage: All calculations have to be arranged as a single directed acycle graph where sinks call upstream values. This means that iterate repeatedly over data isn't possible. Proponents of spreadsheets will argue that visual basic provides the option to iterate, but fail to address the embarrasing poor and obscure nature of most ExcelVBA programmers coding skills. They don't use version control of their code, they can perform an auditable diff between two versions and they surely never do test driven development. In fact this was such a large problem in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis that all the banks have switched to [python](https://calpaterson.com/bank-python.html). \n",

    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole book is centered on profit maximization through application of simulated micro economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start in **part 1** with **Forecasting** in a pursuit to anticipate the workload the supply chain needs to cope with and what revenue this will generate throughout time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is followed in **part 2** by a **Supply Network Analysis** which asks how to exploit any existing contracts and infrastructure to determine costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As both revenues and costs are known, we have what we need to construct what we call the commercial baseline in **part 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **part 4** we address the reality that the commercial environment is not static. It evolves and so should the commercial baseline. We will therefore perform a **competitive analysis** to determine what could be changed to improve the commercial baseline and make the business case for change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the reader is familiar with the construction of a single business case, we will enter the world of discrete event optimization and explore hundreds of business cases automatically and rank them. This is **part 5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to deal with complexity used to be limited to what a person could cope with combined with the power of spreadsheets. However with a very short introduction to the principles of test driven development we can enable anyone to break large tasks down to small testable python functions. The test driven appraoch guarantees the behaviour of our python functions whereby we afterwards can relax and forget about the internals of how the function works. All it takes to solve large complex problems is to chain the specialised functions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practice this means that it should be easier to maintain a good model of a business, rather than trying to second guess the right answer by squinting across dashboards, charts and other visual means that seek to summarize large amounts of data into something that is comprehensible for a decision maker.\n",
    "\n",
    "All software in the book is available to the reader as open source python 3.9+ libraries. No commercial libraries are required."
