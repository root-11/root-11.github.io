# Here are the answers to the 15 most common interview questions that I receive

1. What are your core values and principles as a leader? How do they guide your decisions and actions?

*I'm focused on the evidence. I try to solve problems from a first-principles view once the evidence is clear. This may sound very clinical but it has the benefit that it helps to keep problems and personalities separate whereby I can handle very sensitive issues constructively.*

2. Can you describe a specific situation where you had to demonstrate leadership? What was the outcome, and what did you learn from it?

*I was in a meeting with the executives from 3 organisations who were ready to exit their contracts in dispute. I gently asked for the evidence for each of their views and synthesized their perspectives into a joint action plan that neither of them had thought of. It saved an $80m contract. What I learned? Two things: First, that even though I, by rank was nobody, I still had the analytical skills and business acumen to solve a problem that they couldn't. It grew my confidence in my own abilities. Second, that the scientific approach of asking for evidence can disarm the most tense situation as people reflect upon what they're saying as the request for evidence is free of bias and judgment.*

3. What is your approach to communication with your team and colleagues? How do you ensure transparency and effective collaboration?

*First, I refuse to micromanage. Second, I know that competent people want to communicate freely and constructively, so I consider it my duty to establish an open atmosphere where focal issues can be debated without fear or sense of oppression. In other words: I ensure transparency and effective collaboration by building trust between everyone.*

4. How do you handle adversity and challenges in a leadership role? Can you share an example of a difficult situation you successfully navigated?

*I handle adversity based on the situation. It can range from making hard choices on budgets, to determining how to improve the output from a laggard to tolerating a game of thrones between executives who fail to align on conflicting priorities. I wouldn't know where to start.*

5. What strategies do you employ to motivate and inspire your team? How do you foster a positive and productive work environment?

*I communicate the team mission repeatedly and consistently and remind people of the mission in every context available. This prompts questions about how to deliver the missions and how each and every individual can add value on the journey towards that mission. I manage risks transparently and I showcase both failures and successes without remorse. I believe that to succeed when doing novel work, you have to make experiments and it is only natural that some of those experiments will fail. And by being honest about this is what gives people courage to try, to fail and to try harder. Trust in one-another maintains to be the foundation.*

6. Do you have a specific leadership philosophy or a quote that resonates with you? If so, what is it, and why is it meaningful to you?

*Answering this question without appearing dogmatic or teutonic is a bit difficult, but if you force me to answer in one sentence, I'd say that I adopt the leadership style of the SAS: "Who dares wins". Why? Because if you don't dare to do things differently the competition will eventually beat you. This mindset is a form of continuous self-evaluation which leads to betterment.*

7. How do you balance being a visionary leader with being detail-oriented and practical in your approach?

*The scientific mindset ties the two aspects together into one unity. If the vision cannot be implemented then it is just a dream. inversely all the technical know-how without a clear direction is a waste of resources. To me that is quite simple.*

8. Are you more of a transformational leader who inspires change and innovation, or a transactional leader who focuses on day-to-day tasks and processes?

*I definitely inspire change and innovation. There are others who are more interested at routine drills.*

9. What is your style of conflict resolution? How do you handle disagreements and maintain a harmonious team atmosphere?

*As mentioned earlier, I favor the scientific approach. Be tough on the problem but gentle on the persona.*

10. How do you invest in your own personal and professional growth as a leader? Do you have any ongoing education or self-improvement practices?

*I consider a life long of learning. Why repeat a practice if there is a better way? Sticking to principles that have no merit just seems counterproductive to me.*

11. Can you share a few success stories or specific accomplishments that highlight your leadership abilities and the impact you've had on teams and organizations?

*1: I taught myself to program because I couldn't get funding for a developer and wrote a program that increased LEGOs revenue with $102M.<br>2: I rescued a â‚¬11.5M EU project which was falling apart, by creating a joint plan and aligning 8 independent project groups.<br>3: I built a software platform that increased the technical sales capacity for a $2bn corporation by 800%.*

12. What leadership skills or qualities do you believe set you apart from others? Are there any unique strengths or attributes that make you a standout leader?

*Other people say that I am very very smart. I just think that I have it easy understanding complex systems (with and without people involved).*

13. How do you adapt your leadership style to different situations or team dynamics? Are you versatile in your approach?

*I try to maintain a high situational awareness, but being in tune all the time is exhausting. I guess I'm both versatile and adaptive.*

14. Have you received any formal leadership training or certifications? If so, which ones, and how have they contributed to your leadership style?

*I was trained as Officer in the Army Engineers and received some training with members of the special operations command. I think I've very much adopted their style.*

15. What is your long-term vision for your career as a leader? Where do you see yourself in the next 5-10 years, and how will you continue to grow and evolve in your leadership role?

*I'm looking to take on a 80-120 FTE software development or R&D team, with 8-12 senior managers leading their projects in agile style. Where I am right now, I can only deliver results as there is little space for me to grow.*
