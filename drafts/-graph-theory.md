Graph-theory ([pypi](https://pypi.org/project/graph-theory/), 
[github](https://github.com/root-11/graph-theory)), is a
is a reference implmentation of solutions or solvers to graph-theoretical 
problems in Python3.

The library was born out of irritation as I found myself implementing the 
same kind of solutions for various graph-theory problems repeatedly since 
2016. Eventually, I decided that enough was enough. 
So I developed the graph-theory package as a reference implementation 
under MIT license.

As the library has evolved it has also saved me hundreds of hours, that I
could spend on other - more sophisticated problems. A few of them are 
noteworthy so I'll write them up here.
