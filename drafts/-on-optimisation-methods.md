On optimisation methods.

1. Exhaustive search - explore all combinations. This eliminates any doubt.
[Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)
2. Satisficing search - explore convenient combinations until a solution is
found that is good enough. [Herbert Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon)
3. Approximation - If it is too hard to find a precise solution on the original problem,
make a simplified model of the problem and use its solution.
4. Heuristics - "If you don't know how to solve a particular problem, use a method
that solves similar problems and modify it." [George Polya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya)
5. Greeedy Strategy - Identify the single biggest gain, keep it & repeat the search
on the remainder of the problem.
6. Marginal search - Use a method to construct an initial solution, then use another
method to search for marginal improvements to the initial solution.
7. Ensemble search - From a pool of candidate methods, try them all and pick the best solution.
8. Novelty search - Explore combinations that contain most entropy.
[Kenneth Stanley](http://2018.alife.org/events/kenneth-o-stanley/)
9. Divide and conquer - split the problem into smaller subproblems, divide each subproblem
further until solveable, then combine the partial solutions.
